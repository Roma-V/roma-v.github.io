# Portfolio
A website to show out what I have done in web development.

# Page description
1. It is a portfolio (web dev).
2. A short description of myself and then a list projects.
3. For colors I like is cypress doc pages (green/white). Simple sans-serif fonts should do the job.
4. No images so far. Need to add some improvement in visual part. Plan to provide better views for project listings and some pictures.

# TODOs
- Move draggable text to github pages and add to projects
- Calculator
- Stopwatch/Timer
- Crean out the blog posts page and start adding my own links there
