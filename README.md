# Portfolio
A website to show out what I have done in web development.

# Page description
1. It is a portfolio (web dev).
2. A short description of myself and then a list of projects.
3. For colors I like is cypress doc pages (green/white). Simple sans-serif fonts should do the job.
4. No images so far. Need to add some improvement in visual part. Plan to provide better views for project listings and some pictures.

# TODOs
- Refine draggable text a little bit
- Calculator
- Stopwatch/Timer - finish all features
