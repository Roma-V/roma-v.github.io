        <p>
          Hello, my name is Roman. I am a web developer from Moscow, Russia. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This is my first page. I am proud of putting it out to the internet,
          even though it is simple and plain.
          The page is meant to show my skills and knowledge disregarding how small is the extent thereof.
          As I do progress the page will evolve as well.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content__article">
        <h2 id="overview" class="content__article--heading2">What I stand for</h2>
        <p>
          While learning web development I started analyzing web content and
          decided to create a short list of common requirements 
          that I see important and often times find lacking on web sites.
        </p>
        <h3 class="content__article--heading3">Mobile friendliness</h3>
        <p>
          As of now I mostly use mobile devices for searching internet and looking through new content. 
          At the same time I see throngs of people with smartphones around 
          and realize that most of them make do with desktop computers only occasionally. 
          Thus mobile friendly responsive design is key in modern world.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to content layout a usual problem is touch support on web pages. 
          Sometimes an interface is hard to use on mobile - that is bearable, though frustrating. 
          Sometimes a website is developed with desktop users in mind 
          and there is no way to use some features with touchscreen - 
          because conventional mouse events are used which might have no duplicating touch counterparts.
        </p>
        <h3 class="content__article--heading3">Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          I like going through learning materials but do not have a lot of time for it. 
          Thus it often happens on my way in metro, where I prefer listening to material 
          instead of watching or reading. 
          My best friend is a screen reader: even though far from perfect it helps me a lot. 
          The problem arising is accessibility of pages. 
          The screen reader helps me seeing how little some page owners 
          care about their content being accessible.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content__article">
        <h2 id="skillset" class="content__article--heading2">Where I am and where I go</h2>
        <p>
          I am learning. I have some programming background 
          and therefore working through language features is not a problem. 
          My current focus is on general principles of web design and getting practice.
          Here is the list of resources I have been using and recommend them to others:
        </p>
        <ul class="content__list">
          <li>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Front-end_web_developer">MDN front-end web developer</a> (in process) 
            - one of the best resources covering the very basics. 
            Stretching beyond the course and investigating the contents of numerous links 
            provided throughout the course one finds endless resources for learning. 
            Therefore the course gives both instant knowledge and references for future.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://fullstackopen.com/">Full stack open</a> 
            - a great course covering little bits of everything. 
            It includes both frond-end and backend projects. 
            Even though it does not give a lot of depth, 
            there are a lot of links to learn more on each topic.
            While the material is great, it is based on a number of frameworks 
            and requires some prior knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS basics. 
            Otherwise one can learn how to use a library 
            but end up seeing it as a black box. 
            My recommendation is to go for this course after learning some "vanilla" ways of doing staff.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And this is my plan for the nearest future:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="http://projectodin.com/">Project Odin</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/">Cyber Security Base 2021</a> 
            - a free course series by University of Helsinki on cyber security.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="content__article">
        <h2 id="projects" class="content__article--heading2">What I do</h2>
        <p>
          Here go my projects. There is not a lot to show. Hence I include some planned items.
        </p>
        <ul class="content__list">
          <li>Stopwatch</li>
          <li>Calculator</li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://blog-list-rv.herokuapp.com">List of blog posts</a> 
            - this is a small web app created during FullstackOpen course.
            It consists of React-based front-end, Node.js back-end 
            and cloud based MongoDB database. Also included are some basic tests 
            and Github Actions for testing and deployment. 
            I use it occasionally to save some links to interesting posts 
            for reading some time in the future.

          <li>To do list</li>
